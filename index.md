## Angular with Apache
#### Submitted: 08/15/2017

To simulate some production environment REST services,
I needed to serve an Angular application from Apache on
my local machine. I’ve been enjoying using Angular CLI’s
“ng serve” functionality, and wanted to preserve its convenience.
The “ng serve” command builds the application, starts a
web server and runs the application, and automatically
rebuilds the application if you change any of the application’s
source code files. Apache would provide the Web services,
and I needed to automate the watch and build processes.
